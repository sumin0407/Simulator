# SIMVA-SoS?

SIMVA-SoS is a simulation-based verification and analysis tool for system of systems. It simulates a system of systems, and performs statistical model checking to verify the achievement of SoS-level goals. SoS-level goals can be translated into properties of the SoS. It is an open framework consisting of independent modules: simulator, property checker and statistical hypothesiss test module.
